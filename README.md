</p>

The user can create (and delete) projects. Within each project, it is possible to create to-dos.

Each to-do consists of a title, due date, description, and priority. The priority will define the background color of each to-do. Red for high and yellow for medium priority.

Once a to-do it's created, it will also be possible to edit or delete it. When editing, it is possible to make changes in all fields, including the project to which it belongs.

It is also important to emphasize that if the user deletes a project, the notes that belong to it also will be.
